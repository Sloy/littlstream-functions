# Littlstream Functions

Backend code for the littlstream tool for PSVR using Firebase Functions. 
Littlstream was a service to stream 3D SBS VR videos from your computer to Playstation VR using the old Littlstar application.

This service is no longer available. Feel free to do whatever with the code.
